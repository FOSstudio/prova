    <p>Peter Aldington, interview</p>
    <p>My name is Peter Aldington, I’m an architect. I practiced in the village of Haddenham in Buckinghamshire for 22 years, between 1964 and 1986, when I ceased practicing, at the age of 56, because by then I’d found architecture in this country to be a very frustrating business. At that stage I had started designing gardens for people who asked me. I enjoyed that for 10/15 years. I have since then never practiced at all. I was trained at the Manchester University of Architecture, which is sadly no longer there, and after university I went to work for the London County Council Architect Department, in their housing division, designing mass housing. While there, I got called up for national service, although I tried to avoid it, but couldn’t. After two years of national service, I took the opportunity of wandering around the continent a little bit and looking at some modern architecture of various kinds. I then went back to the London County Council and in 1961 I received my first commission for a house in Buckinghamshire. I eventually lived in that house because my clients went abroad, just as it was being finished. That led to us designing and building other three houses in Haddenham, where we still are. 

While we lived at Askett Green this first house I built I met a gentleman called John Craig who lived behind the corner who was very anti-modern architecture but when he came inside Askett Green he realised that there was a lot more to modern architecture than he had suspected and we hit it off in other words we related to each other very well and started to work together. This ended up with John who at that time worked for an advertising agency Garland Compton in London. He eventually became a part of Saatchi & Saatchi, very well know. Asking me if I was interested in taking part in an interview process to redesign the whole six stories of their London offices and I won that selection and John and I worked on that for three years in the late sixties after it was completed I asked John if he'd like to join me as a partner and he very bravely took a 50% cut in salary to do just that. John was not a qualified architect in fact he wasn't a qualified anything. He'd left school with no exam results whatever which is ironic because he ended up teaching in a school of architecture which he could not have entered as a student in any way because of lack of qualifications. I asked John because he had a very profound ability to communicate and to relate to clients. He demonstrated this during the office conversion process we just completed where he used to relate to each department and get inside the way they worked so his rule in the practice was to talk to the clients to analyse what they wanted to achieve and to write a brief which he then presented to me. And during that process I had no contact with the client at all as far as possible so I was able to see this summation of what could be up to a year's work into clients or maybe only a month's work depending on the size job and the nature of the project and was able to absorb that in half an hour to an hour without any preconceptions whatsoever. John had preconceptions but he didn't communicate them to me naturally which meant that the design process was very short and brief because all the information which is not just factual information but desire information and constraints which is the site and it's surroundings was all there in front of me in black and white writing not drawings and I was able to absorb that and start the design process and John was able to then act as the client in the office and translate how I may or may not had interpreted what he'd written and act as a critic of what was being designed while it was happening and we advertised that precess to our clients by saying John Craig is your representative in the office, which was a fairly unique way of working.

Well I deliberately I'm not interested in other people's architecture I believe it's a process which comes from within the designer and yes the designer has been influenced by all sorts of things he's seen and heard especially when he's studying as a student but I don't consciously try and emulate or learn from other architects I'm my own manners as far as I'm concerned and what's more important to me is not style or form but the materials I'm building out of. Architecture comes out of the materials the building is built out of so the house i'm sitting in now for instance which is my own house i've got photographs of that house under construction and photographs after it's finished and they are practically the same probably a coat of paint different that's all.

I see the architect as a builder and in an ideal world I would have designed and built (?) to do with my own house but the reality of life is that you can't do that but I used to say that I was building the house on the drawing board I'd practiced in the days when we didn't design things on computers we designed them on drawing boards and I believe still that the hand done drawing is probably a way to proceed before translating on to machinery a very simple approach that a building consists of one thing it could be a wall could be a column could be a post holding up another thing and I believe that once should express that is what's happening in the realisation of the building.

The first house I built Askett Green which we lived in was very much a box and everything happened inside that box and through the experience of borrowing that house for three years I became dissatisfied because the outside was another world even though there was a big glazed door you could walk in and out of there seemed to be no relationship between the outside and the inside so when we came to design this housing group in Haddenham I was determined that the outside should be part of the inside and the inside part of the outside so if you have rafters visible or beams visible inside they pass through the wall and appear on the outside so that the same detail is happening means you probably have to treat them in a different way to preserve them form the elements but as a sort of integrity so you can walk from inside through not through a window through a transparent wall because when we have transparency we try and not put a window frame in the opening and the opening is formed by walls on either side a beam at the top and a floor continuing at the bottom so there is no demarcation between inside and outside.

Well yes I mean we all know that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and so one uses that knowledge to place windows so you can direct the light in top the heart of the house if you want to. Our living room has both east and west facing windows high double glazing facing east and we're able to project that light into the centre of the house over dividing walls which are between the kitchen and the living room but are kept at a height while retaining privacy from one side to the other although enough allow the sunlight to stream over the top.

Well John's briefs weren't just about lists of accomodations and in fact we used to avoid saying I want a three bedroom house rather we would say there are three people living in this house and they all need somewhere to sleep as together or separately. As soon as you say three bedroom you're actually preconceiving that house has three separate rooms and it's not necessarily so. For instance in our own house there is no master bedroom the main bed is in the living room and that's a product of rationalising how one wants to use the house in other words we try to explore uses and desires if you like to see the morning sun from your breakfast table that went into part of the brief and if you didn't like to see the sun that was just as important and that went in as part of the brief. There was one classic example in a house we built in Devon which was for family friends he was a pharmacist and had a pharmacist shop in the town of Barnstaple in Devon and she had been my fathers secretary but was now a family friend and he used to bring work his books in particular home in the evening and work in the living room and she said "I'm not having this beautiful new house with this beautiful view down the valley and seeing you, Ian, that was the name of her husband, spread your papers all over the living room you will have a study" she said this to John writing the brief and he said to John "I'm not having a study, I'm not spending all this money on this beautiful house in this beautiful valley and being shut away in a little study. I want to sit in the living room at work and they met (?) like that and they were a couple that, we never witnessed an argument but they were violently different views of the same thing and John said alright I've spoken to both of you, I've written down both views let the architect solve it. Bastard. And I was presented with this, and what came out of that. It was a house on a sloping hillside. It was a two level house I mean we would have had to build two levels anyhow unless we built up the side or dug out the side on the upper level it was an entrance dining kitchen on the lower level was a living room and there was a drop between the two of about four steps, nearly a metre. Between the two partially taking up the whole space but only part of the space between the two we built a low wall enclosure or a carrel. The walls of that enclosure and it was tiny like two and a half metres times one and a half, something like that. The high level floor the wall was twelve hundred millimetres high from the living room the lower level it was over two metres high. And that became the study he was able to sit in that the papers were screened from view on both levels but he could see over the top over his living room down into the view and we satisfied both parties we built the study but he didn't have to go to a study he was still in his living room and that's the power of having a very clear and cogent brief. It took them a long time to accept that and in fact one time stage where the building was partly finished the May, the lady of the house, said "it's not going to work Peter. I'll put the washing machine in it." And apparently I stood up to leave and said if you do that May, I'm leaving now and John had to come and hold me back and said you can't say that well I've just said it and anyhow we made our peace and John said look, if it doesn't work at our expense we will alter it. They moved in and three weeks later we got a letter saying "Thank you very much. We didn't know that was what we wanted. It's the best bit of the house and we call it the dog house."

I think that any feeling of warmth and domesticity in our buildings comes out of: A, our reaction to the client and the way they live and the objects they have and B, the materials which we choose to use and the way we use them and to us the materials spoke to us about how they wanted to be used if that's not a stupid thing to say there no sort of conscious aim at domesticity it comes out of the process and they way we built and used the materials. One of the last houses I built was of steel and glass house in Suffolk called the Wedgewood house. Those clients came to us because Mrs. Wedgewood had sat in the hairdressers, as ladies do, reading magazines and had seen a house of ours with an upstairs living room and bedrooms downstairs built out of brick timber and concrete and she came to us because she said you are the specialist in upside down houses and we said no we're not we design houses as a reaction to the site and all sorts of other criteria. That one was an upside down house because the view was obtainable when you went up a floor and they said well we've got a site where you need to go up to see the view. So we went to see the site and they were quite right although we discovered you could see the view if you climbed up one metre it was just looking over some very distance treetops into the Stour Valley which is Constable Country. They thought they were going to get e brick and timber house which is all they'd seen us build in fact it was all we had built but it became clear from the protracted briefing process and studying the site which was part of a large garden of Mrs. Wedgewords own house there were a couple of married in their sixties and they were both widows and it was an absolute beautiful and immaculate garden and very difficult to access without building a whole roadway into it so we came to the conclusion that we needed to be a building we could put on a site without disturbing the site very much in other words it had to be a lot of it had to be prefabricated off the site so we opted for a steel frame without a glass or sandwich construction panel infillings which was able to go up while Harrold Wedgword still mowed the lawn right to the edge of the building all the time it was being built so that justified our decision. We also chose that material because it was able to give us large areas of uninterrupted glass and we discovered through the briefing process again that they spent most of their time outside in the garden growing their own food. So they needed: A, some where to store it and B, they wanted a house where they could press a switch and walk in and it was warm so the traditional methods of heating a house where you rely on the mass of the construction to retain warmth weren't applicable. And so we built a house which is very lightweight there were no walls to retain the warmth but it was fitted with radiant ceiling heating behind the ceiling and you press the switch and immediately you had radiant heat. So we presented them with a radically different approach to anything they expected or had seen before. They were highly skeptical. I escaped on holiday while John presented it to them for which he never forgave me because he had a very difficult job and he did. I gathered and I didn't tell him this until afterwards they he had offered to start again if they couldn't accept that design they did accept it and again we got a letter a few weeks after they moved in saying "thank you very much we never imagined that this was the thought of house we really needed but it is". So that again justified the whole process and I think domesticity and feeling of warmth come out of that process not out any sort of conscious effort to do otherwise.  Any building a detail is purely a method of putting a building together. It's not something you apply afterwards and in these I used to stay at a student's when I used to teach at the same time as considering the layout of a building or buildings on the side at a very small scale I was thinking about the sort of toilet role hole that one would use. In other words you are thinking about the whole thing from the scale of the human being touching it to the conceptual thought which go into relating to the building surroundings. At the same time it is not a sequential process it's a whole process which is happening all at once and certainly some of the earliest drawings I did of these houses were of details where wall meets roof meets clerestory window meets second roof. Details of the way the building is put together in other words without really knowing what the form of the building was. It's all happening at once and together and that is quite a difficult process particularly for a student to get ahold of.

We did one or two interiors throughout the life of the practice and I used to describe those as we were building a village inside an existing building so it's the same sort of thinking really. Yes the room is a sort of village within in fact you may have seen the book which published about these houses: A Gardner and Three Houses. Jane Brown wrote it once said "I could quite happily rent your room that would be my house: it's got everything in it". That's this room we're sitting in right now it's got the two floors it's got the height it's got the east light coming in through a high double window. That's a complete house as far as I'm concerned.  I try in designing buildings to blur the boundaries between what goes on outside and what goes on inside so you can see behind me now a planting which could be outside but is in fact inside. It's underneath an insulated translucent roof but if I look to my right through the glass door I'm looking outside and the same wall which you see behind me carries on through the outside space to form a boundary of a courtyard and enters another wing of the house with the living room in it at the other side of that courtyard so that as a continuum from the inside to the outside to the inside and again on the other side to the outside again and it's a very strong linking element.

I think once Louis Kahn once said "Don't build corridors build meeting places" which is very true. I try not to link things together with just a route which you don't do anything in other than walk getting from one space to another is a means of interaction between people. The spaces we designed, the houses we designed were designed around ways of living. We don't design the way of living, we design a place where living can happen and we've designed those places because we've analysed the way the people who have to go and occupy them probably would like to live.  Well look at my desk: disorder. Ordered disorder I think is in other words if you walk around my garden now. I know at this time of the year it's a bit hard to discern but in the middle of the summer it looks like chaos because there is so much growth but as a client who came around with me once said: "this is ordered disorder isn't it?". And I think that was a very good description.

I think that steel and glass and fibreglass and plastic can be human. It's the way you use them. One of the finer projects I did was a steel framed extension to a rather unpleasant metal bungalow. A bungalow is a single story house. And to me and to many of the owners who have owned that and a number of them have it's still a warm and welcoming space and yet the finishes inside is a corrugated metal roof and steel beams with glass walls and the opaque walls are either painters MDF or fibreglass but it's still a warm interior and I think that is the way the designers interpreted and used those materials. 

Well some of the things that are around are because one just likes the form and there are some stones on the shelf just to my left some of which came from an Icelandic glacier and there they are because they remind me of being in Iceland and on that glacier. Others are flints we found in the hardcore underneath these houses when we were building these houses water warm forms which are like little sculptures and so we collected those. I have a collection of teddy bears cause I'm very fond of teddy bears in particular A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh which we used to read to each other at bedtime when we were first married and so there are all sorts of connections like that. They are all part of life, are they not? We don't have ornaments because we think they are valuable in fact we have very few things even handed down from long since dead ancestors but we collect things because we like them.
