Please tell us about your experience, 
life and career?<br>

<p class="paragraph">
My name is Peter Aldington, I’m an architect. I practiced in the village of Haddenham in Buckinghamshire for 22 years, between 1964 and 1986. In 1986 I stopped practicing, at the age of 56, because by then I’d found architecture in this country to be a very frustrating business. At that stage I had started designing gardens for people who asked me to. I enjoyed that for 10-15 years. I have since then never practiced at all.
I was trained at the Manchester University of Architecture, which is sadly no longer there. After university I went to work for the London County Council Architect Department, in their housing division, designing mass housing.<br>

I was trained at the Manchester University of Architecture, which is sadly no longer there. After university I went to work for the London County Council Architect Department, in their housing division, designing mass housing. While there, I got called up for national service, although I had unsuccessfully tried to avoid it. After two years of national service, I took the opportunity of wandering around the continent a little bit and looking at some modern architecture of various kinds. I then went back to the London County Council and in 1961 received my first commission for a house in Buckinghamshire. I eventually lived in that house because my clients went abroad, just as it was being finished. That led to us designing and building other three houses in Haddenham,where we still are.
